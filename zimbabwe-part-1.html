		<p>Chance&nbsp;to see the outside world is one of my reason to take&nbsp;this job :).
Never ever crossed&nbsp;in my mind before that I will visit this country. I
have heard about this country before &nbsp;when economic crisis hit this
country around 2008. &nbsp;1 trillion&nbsp;dollar zimbabwe equals to 1 USD, such
an epic story. My impression first time I hit this country is that, it
looks like&nbsp;Indonesia, on 1970's :) ( don't get me wrong, I see 1970's
picture of Indonesia in some&nbsp;old movie, I wasn't born yet that day :p ).
If you see the buses, the people, and how the city looks like, then you
might end up with the same conclusion with me :D.</p>

<p>No pic hoax ? Here's one of the picture I took during my journey from
hotel to /// office. Unfortunately I don't have the picture for the old
buses (updated), but you can imagine inter-city bus, with full of bag
loaded on top of it. Yeah, one of the problem here is transportation.
Those buses seem to only pass once in a few hour. Once they passed,
there will be so many people waiting, together with their belongings. I
also see some people waive their hands on the streets looking for a car
lift. Not sure if it is safe to give them a lift, since I'm just a
foreigner here.</p>
<p>---- Updated</p>
<p>Here's the bus view in Harare..</p>

</div>
<p>But wait, there's also tall building here in this country :). During my
first week here, /// put me on Crowne plaza hotel located on the city
centre, surrounded by few tall buildings.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<p>See ? Not too bad, except the internet speed :D. I can only really
browse the internet on 5-6 AM in the morning. When I came back to hotel
from the office around 7-8, the internet speed is horrible. I waited so
long to open a webpage ( which then ended up with me closing the laptop
and go to sleep :p). Yeah, the infrastructure is not good here.
Telecommunications and Transportation, those 2 things need to be
improved first here before they want to go to the next step.</p>
<p>--- Updated, here's the other city view of Harare..</p>

</div>
<p>Now, the good thing about this country is that, there's almost no
traffic jam :). We can go to the airport from /// office in about 30
minutes on daytime.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="http://theprasojos.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2014-06-25-08-51-41.jpg?h=100&amp;w=500" />
</div>
<p>Wider road with less cars, compare this to Jakarta :). And yes, I rarely seen
any motor bikes here, which is probably a good thing :D.</p>
<p>And the other good thing, Indonesia has its embassy here. So, I went
there to meet with the people and to introduce myself. It's good to have
Indonesian friends in this nowhere country :D, at least I can speak
bahasa again after so long. Feels like home, but not the real home :).
The embassy staff are very helpful, if you imagine that all government
officers are hard, rigid, then you are wrong. They are all very friendly
here. I went there almost every weekend, just to say hi, and to talk to
them. &nbsp;And yes, they held a friendly 17an match to celebrate Indonesia's
independence day, where &nbsp;I won Gaple match, with pak Tachsin Fernandi as
my co-player....:)</p>

</div>
<p>There's only about 40 Indonesian people here in Zimbabwe, including the kids.
Not so much, but that makes them&nbsp;big family together in a foreign
country :) If you are interested more, just invite their Facebook
account &quot;Perwakin Harare&quot;.</p>
<p>Ok, that is all for part 1, time to go back to the apartment and prepare
some meal for Ifthar.</p>
